## What Is Urban Beekeeping?

Urban beekeeping is the practice of keeping honeybee colonies in city environments — on rooftops, balconies, and even small backyards. As urban spaces grow, more and more people are turning to this rewarding hobby that helps pollinate local plants and supports bee populations.

- Pollination Power: Bees help fertilize plants, increasing urban biodiversity.
